# BachelorProject
Bachelor project of Luuk Kaandorp for the study Information Sciences (previously IMM) at the VU Amsterdam. In collaboration with Ivano Malavolta.

## The goal
The goal of the project is to assess the whether Android Runner can accurately measure energy consumption. We do this by creating synthetic apps which test hardware components of the phone. We then measure this using Android Runner and compare this to our base test results which where measured directly from the phone's hardware.

## The apps
* [Baseline](/Apps/Baseline)
* [Accelerometer](/Apps/AccelerometerTest)
* [Ambient Light Sensor](/Apps/AmbientLightTest)
* [Camera](/Apps/CameraTest)
* [CPU Factorial](/Apps/CpuFactorialTest)
* [GPS](/Apps/GpsTest)
* [Gravity Sensor](/Apps/GravityTest)
* [Gyroscope](/Apps/GyroscopeTest)
* [Local Storage](/Apps/WriteLocalTest)
* [Magnetic Field Sensor](/Apps/MagneticFieldTest)
* [Microphone](/Apps/MicrophoneTest)
* [Room Database](/Apps/WriteRoomTest)
* [SD-Card](/Apps/WriteSdTest)
