# Display Test
This app tests the display energy consumption by playing a .mp4 video file.

## How does it work?
This app plays a .mp4 video file in landscape mode to use most of the display real-estate. When replicating this experiment, please do not forget to set the phone's screen brightness to 100%.

## Benchmark settings
Use phone settings:
* Disable WiFi
* Set screen brightness to its maximum (important for this test)
* Disable location services

Use config.json settings:
* `enable_systrace_parsing` set to False
