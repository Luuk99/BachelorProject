# Microphone Test
This app tests the microphone energy consumption by recording audio to a .3gp file.

## How does it work?
This app records audio from the microphone infinitely and writes this to a .3gp file.

## Benchmark settings
Use phone settings:
* Disable WiFi
* Set screen brightness to its minimum
* Disable location services

Use config.json settings:
* `enable_systrace_parsing` set to False
